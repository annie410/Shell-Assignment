1.1 I see a list of all the folders in the directory, and all the pdf documents I have saved in that folder too, but not the files saved inside the folders.

1.2 ls -lrS Now I see far more information about each of the files, including the date and time when they were created (or last modified, I'm not sure). I also see numbers which I assume are their size, a bunch of letters I don't understand and another column of numbers which (this is a guess) shows how many files are inside that file/folder.

1.2b oops I already did that above 

2.1 pwd -> print working directory, /Users/annie/Desktop/Data Analysis, all black, files have their extensions printed and folders don't 

2.2 cd -> change directory, pwd = /User/Annie/Desktop/Data Analysis, cd .. goes to the directory above (desktop), cd - , cd shell_magic


3.1 it created two separate files, one called hello and the other called world, implying spaces aren't good in file names

3.2 mkdir -> make directory

3.3 mv -> move, touch hello_world didn't work because there is already a folder called hello_world in the working directory, touch hello_world.bfe, touch hello_world.bfe hello_world.txt, mv hello_world.txt ./hello_world, mv ./hello_world ., mv ../hello_wrold.txt ./, ./hello_world.txt ../

3.4 copying creates a second file in the new location whereas moving puts the original file in a new place, ../hello_world.txt ./, ../hello_world.txt ./world_hello.txt

3.5 rm --> remove, pwd, cd .., rm ./hello_world.txt, hello_world is a directory, rm -r ./hello_world

4.1 cat --> concentrate and print, nothing, because the file is empty

4.2 man --> write arguments to the standard output, echo "file contents" > file.txt, echo "more contents">>file.txt, cat ./file.txt

4.3

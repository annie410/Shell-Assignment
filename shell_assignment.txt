1.1 I see a list of all the folders in the directory, and all the pdf documents I have saved in that folder too, but not the files saved inside the folders.

1.2 ls -lrS Now I see far more information about each of the files, including the date and time when they were created (or last modified, I'm not sure). I also see numbers which I assume are their size, a bunch of letters I don't understand and another column of numbers which (this is a guess) shows how many files are inside that file/folder.

1.2b oops I already did that above 

2.1 pwd -> print working directory, /Users/annie/Desktop/Data Analysis, all black, files have their extensions printed and folders don't 

2.2 cd -> change directory, pwd = /User/Annie/Desktop/Data Analysis, cd .. goes to the directory above (desktop), cd - , cd shell_magic


3.1 it created two separate files, one called hello and the other called world, implying spaces aren't good in file names

3.2 mkdir -> make directory

3.3 mv -> move, touch hello_world didn't work because there is already a folder called hello_world in the working directory, touch hello_world.bfe, touch hello_world.bfe hello_world.txt, mv hello_world.txt ./hello_world, mv ./hello_world ., mv ../hello_wrold.txt ./, ./hello_world.txt ../

3.4 copying creates a second file in the new location whereas moving puts the original file in a new place, ../hello_world.txt ./, ../hello_world.txt ./world_hello.txt

3.5 rm --> remove, pwd, cd .., rm ./hello_world.txt, hello_world is a directory, rm -r ./hello_world

4.1 cat --> concentrate and print, nothing, because the file is empty

4.2 man --> write arguments to the standard output, echo "file contents" > file.txt, echo "more contents">>file.txt, cat ./file.txt

4.3 ls -R ~/Desktop > home_contents.list, when viewing a file that has a lot of contents 

5.1 wc --> word count, 8715 (lines)  12764 (words)  198034 (characters), 
cat ./home_contents.list | wc, 
the numbers are the same. The difference is that the computer is first executing the cat command but not printing the results, before executing the wc command. 
ls ./ |wc

5.2 echo -e "hello world" \n "world hello" > helloworld.txt, 
grep world ./helloworld.txt, 
hello world 
world hello

echo "world hello" > worldhello.txt, 

grep world ./helloworld.txt ./worldhello.txt
./helloworld.txt:hello world 
./helloworld.txt:world hello
./worldhello.txt:world hello

grep hello ./helloworld.txt

cat ./helloworld.txt |grep world|wc|less

6.2
My Mac did it automatically for me when I downloaded the file manually, but I suppose it would be tar -x ./aup.tar.gz |gunzip -c 

find ./aup

At most 4 levels deep e.g.: ./aup/cohort1/s045fint/s045fint4.aup

less ./aup/cohort1/s045fint/s045fint4.aup

find ./aup  -print | wc -l ; 1381 files

curl https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_number-one_songs_in_Norway | grep -E

find ./aup |grep -E "cohort3" | less

find ./aup -print |grep -E "cohort3" | wc -l ; 455 files

find ./aup -print |grep -E "cohort1[Ë†\.5]" | wc -l ; 450 files

find ./aup -print |grep -E "cohort2/s...[mf]ssc" | wc -l ; 119

find ./aup |grep -E "cohort2/s...[mf]ssc" | cat > ./ssc_cohort2.list
